                        <h3>History and Location</h3>

                        <p class="bottom-padd">
                            Founded in 2003 by experienced industry partners, City Constructors started with the idea of creating a construction company that could meet the needs of stakeholders revitalizing downtown Los Angeles at the time. We established our first office in the historic Bradbury Building on 3rd and Broadway, and from there oversaw renovations of several large loft projects in downtown. As we expanded we moved to a vibrant neighborhood on the forefront of the City’s resurgence known as the Arts District. Although our roots are in downtown, we work throughout greater Los Angeles and have recently expanded to San Francisco.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Experience and Core Competencies</h3>

                        <p>
                            Our firm’s incorporators each have years of experience in construction, property management, and architectural design. This depth of experience reaches into our field teams as well. On average our project managers have over twenty years of experience and our superintendents over ten years. Our office staff hold academic degrees ranging from disciplines such as engineering management to law.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Our core competencies are adaptive reuse, hospitality, creative office space renovations and tenant improvement projects ranging in size from just under one million dollars to upwards of twenty million dollars. The industries we have worked with include hospitality, industrial, and software startup/communications; and we are particularly adept at working with historic buildings.
                        </p>

                        </p>

                            Mr. Reaume’s long family history in the industry and his service in the military have taught him the value of an honest day’s work and the value of maintaining relationships, something that he instills at all levels of CCI.
